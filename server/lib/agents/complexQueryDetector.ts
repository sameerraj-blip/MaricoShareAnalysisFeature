AVAILABLE DATA:
- Total rows: ${summary.rowCount}
- Total columns: ${summary.columnCount}
- All columns: ${allColumns}
- Numeric columns: ${numericColumns}
${dateColumns ? `- Date columns: ${dateColumns}` : ''}

COMPLEX QUERY CRITERIA:
A query is considered "complex" if it requires ANY of the following:

1. MULTIPLE CONDITIONS/FILTERS:
   - Multiple filters combined with AND/OR logic
   - Examples: "Which months had revenue above average BUT only from category X"
   - Examples: "Which SKUs had sales > 1000 AND discount < 10% AND category = 'X'"
   - Examples: "Which categories had growth in Q4 compared to Q3, while also having sales above threshold"

2. REFERENCE-BASED COMPARISONS:
   - Comparisons to calculated values (averages, medians, percentiles, etc.)
   - Examples: "above the yearly monthly average", "below average", "above median"
   - Examples: "above the mean", "exceeding the 75th percentile"
   - Examples: "Which months had revenue above the yearly monthly average"

3. TEMPORAL COMPARISONS:
   - Comparing values across different time periods
   - Examples: "Which months had higher revenue in 2024 compared to 2023"
   - Examples: "Which categories grew from Q3 to Q4"
   - Examples: "Which SKUs had better performance this year vs last year"

4. MULTI-LEVEL AGGREGATIONS:
   - Aggregations combined with grouping and filtering
   - Examples: "Which categories had total revenue above X, but only counting orders with discount < 10%"
   - Examples: "Which months had sum of revenue above average, grouped by category"
   - Examples: "Which SKUs had average order size > 10, but only from repeat customers"

5. CONDITIONAL GROUPING:
   - Grouping with conditional filters
   - Examples: "Which months/categories/SKUs had X above Y, but only from [filtered subset]"
   - Examples: "Which products had sales above threshold, but only in specific regions"

6. NESTED CONDITIONS:
   - Conditions within conditions
   - Examples: "Which months had revenue above average, but only from orders where discount was below 10% AND category was X"
   - Examples: "Which categories had growth, but only for products with price > $50 AND rating > 4"

7. MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS:
   - Queries involving multiple grouping dimensions simultaneously
   - Examples: "Which category-month combinations had revenue above threshold"
   - Examples: "Which SKU-category pairs had sales growth"

SIMPLE QUERY EXAMPLES (NOT complex):
- "What is the average revenue?" → Simple statistical query
- "Show me revenue over time" → Simple chart request
- "What affects revenue?" → Simple correlation query
- "Which month had the highest revenue?" → Simple statistical query (single condition)
- "What is the sum of value for category X?" → Simple aggregation (single filter)
- "Show me trends in revenue" → Simple chart request

COMPLEX QUERY EXAMPLES:
- "Which months had total revenue above the yearly monthly average, but only from orders with discounts below 10%" → COMPLEX (multiple conditions + reference comparison)
- "Which SKUs had higher revenue in Q4 compared to Q3, while also selling more than 2,000 total units in the year" → COMPLEX (temporal comparison + multiple conditions)
- "Which categories had revenue growth in 2020 by value, but only for products with price above $50" → COMPLEX (temporal comparison + conditional filter)
- "Which months had revenue above average, but only from category X, and only for orders placed after 2020" → COMPLEX (reference comparison + multiple filters)
- "Which products had sales above threshold in Q4, but only counting repeat customers who ordered more than 5 times" → COMPLEX (temporal + conditional + nested conditions)

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- A query with a SINGLE condition (e.g., "above 1000") is usually NOT complex
- A query with a SINGLE filter (e.g., "for category X") is usually NOT complex
- Complexity comes from COMBINING multiple conditions, filters, aggregations, or comparisons
- Queries that require calculating averages/medians FIRST, then comparing, are complex
- Queries that compare across time periods are complex
- Queries with "but only", "while also", "and also", "combined with" often indicate complexity

  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
